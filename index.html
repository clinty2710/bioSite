                <p> Kevin is a good friend of mine. He&#39s always happy and loves to feel the energy of those around him. 
                    He loves passion - in whatever sense it is! He's said, <q>I love seeing the fire behind someone&#39s eyes! 
                    When someone talks passionately about their favorite subject, their whole demeanor changes. 
                    Everything lights up and becomes that much more important&#8230</q>, and that&#39s also what you always get when 
                    conversing with him.
                </p>
                <p> We are fellow performers and we both met working at Walt Disney World. We quickly 
                    became friends and now are roommates. In his interview questions he responded with such love about cats. 
                    His face lights up every time he sees and interacts with my cat, Lily. He also mentioned that his hobbies 
                    include video games but what he didn&#39t mention was the fact that he LOVES anything that has to do with 
                    The Legend of Zelda, especially the title character. Princess Zelda speaks to his inner princess. 
                    Not only does he resonate with Princess Zelda, he&#39s a fan of Princess Peach from Super Mario Bros. and 
                    Sailor Moon.  The Logo for his Photography business has a yellow moon in it which is a nod to Sailor Moon. 
                    Speaking of, he continues his love for seeing <q>fire behind someone&#39s eyes</q> by capturing it in photos.
                </p>
                <p> Not only does he work as a full-time performer and go to school, He continues to progress in his photography 
                    skills. Kevin is a wonderful friend and all around awesome, fun and loving person. 
                    I&#39m blessed to have him as my friend.
